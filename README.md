<h3>Description:</h3>
<body>The purpose of this project was to create an internal network via Virtualbox and simulate suspicious network activity from within that internal network onto a Windows 11 machine. The network the Windows 11 machine was operating on was monitored utilizing Snort and any malicious activity was logged and prevented through Snort's inline mode. After creating logs, a Splunk forwarder was used to relay them to an external SIEM server for further threat analysis.</body>
   </br>
   </br>
<b>Throughout the course of this project, some roadblocks I ran into were:</b></br>
   * Figuring out that although the virtual machines were placed on the same internal network through Virtualbox's network settings, that they were still not able to communicate with each other. I had manually assigned them IPs within the same subnet, but wasn't aware that I needed to create a network adapter in order to act as a DHCP server, place those virtual machines on that virtual network, and have DHCP assign them those IPs automatically.
   </br>
   - Creating a NAT network to place both VMs 3 & 4 on in order to allow communication between the internal and external network.

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

   <p align="center">
      To facilitate communication between VMs on the internal network, Adapter #2 was created, enabling the DHCP server to distribute those IPs amongst the VMs. From there, each virtual machine was manually assigned an IP address within that subnet. VM3 was configured with 2 network profiles allowing it to communicate with both the internal network, and VM4 on the outside through NAT (2nd screenshot).

      Snort was installed onto VM3 and the configuration file, snort.conf, was edited utilizing vim text editor. The HOME_NET variable was given the subnet of the internal network.

      <p align="center">
         The IP address in which the Splunk Forwarder would be forwarding it's logs to was added utilizing port 9997 which is used for splunk-to-splunk communication. Port 9997 is Splunk's default port for the transfer of data and ensures secure, reliable, and       encrypted transfer of data to prevent unathorized access.

      <p align="center">
         Next, I added the log file that Splunk would be forwarding to the server and that was the Snort alert file as seen below. Directly after that, I went back one directory and jumped into /etc/apps/search/local as root and added lines 1, 2, and 5-7 to assist Splunk in it's indexing process.
